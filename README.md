This [**starter template**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) helps you automate testing
of web applications and REST/HTTP APIs using [**Serenity/JS**](https://serenity-js.org) and the [**Playwright Test**](https://playwright.dev/) runner,
and comes pre-configured with **TypeScript**, linting, reporting, and example test scenarios.

Use this template to accelerate your test automation setup
and generate [enhanced Playwright Test reports](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/#reporting)
and [Serenity BDD living documentation](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/).

- [Enhanced Playwright Test report](https://serenity-js.github.io/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/playwright/)

## Features

- Pre-configured **Serenity/JS** + **Playwright Test** + **TypeScript** setup
- Example web and REST API test scenarios
- Integrated reporting with **Serenity BDD** and **Playwright Test** HTML reports
- Linters, CI-ready scripts, and development environment support
- Ready-to-use GitHub Codespaces environment using the official [Serenity/JS Docker image](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/integration/docker/)

## Quick Start

### Explore instantly in GitHub Codespaces

Launch this project in an online development environment:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?ref=main&repo=serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)

### Run locally

#### 1. Prerequisites

Follow the [Serenity/JS installation guide](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/about/installation/) to set up your development environment with the following prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Java JRE 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html)

#### 2. Create your project

[Create a new GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) from this template and
[clone it](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your machine:

```shell
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project>
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies and [Playwright browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers):

```shell
npm ci
npx playwright install
```

##### Corporate networks

If your environment requires proxy configuration or an internal registry like Artifactory or Nexus, add an [`.npmrc` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc) file
with the appropriate configuration to your home directory:

```
proxy=http://user:password@host.mycompany.com:8080/
https-proxy=http://user:password@host.mycompany.com:8080/
strict-ssl=false
registry=https://artifactory.mycompany.com/artifactory/
```

#### 4. Run tests

Run the example tests:
```
npm test
```

#### 5. View reports

View the test reports generated under the following paths:

- **Serenity BDD**: `./target/site/serenity/index.html`
- **Playwright Test**: `./playwright-report/index.html`

Alternatively, serve the Serenity BDD report using the built-in HTTP server,
accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):
```
npm run start
```

## Execution

The project provides several [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts) defined in [`package.json`](package.json):

```
npm run lint            # runs code linter
npm run lint:fix        # attempts to automatically fix linting issues
npm run clean           # removes reports from any previous test run
npm test                # executes the example test suite
                        # and generates the report under ./target/site/serenity
npm start               # starts a mini HTTP server and serves the test reports
                        # at http://localhost:8080
```

## Next steps

- Replace the example tests with your own
- Add new tasks, interactions, and assertions using Serenity/JS
- Extend the test suite or integrate it into CI/CD pipelines
- Use the sample reports to understand expected testing and reporting workflows
